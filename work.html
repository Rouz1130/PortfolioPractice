          <h3>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h3>
          <p>A software appliction to track both bands and venues to view where each band played concerts at. As a user you are allowed to create bands and assign them to a particular venue. A venue can host many bands, and a band can play at any venue that has been created. A user can also view a single venue to list out all of the bands that have played at that venue and vice versa for a venue to list out all the bands that played there.</p>
          <br>
          <p><h4>LANGUAGES AND TOOLS</h4>SQL database server integration and C# were the tools and languages used for this project.
            Three tables were created one for Bands, one for Venues, and a join table to store the relationship between both tables </p>
